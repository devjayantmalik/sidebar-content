# Responsive Sidebar and Content Area

The application automatically resizes the content area based on the inner width of windows.

This type of effect is used by google material design.

Here is how this program works:

On less than 900px:

- Sidebar is displayed on full screen, incase any item is clicked on sidebar, then the sidebar disappears and content is shown.
- On the content screen is you press the back button, then the sidebar is shown and the content disappears.

You can test this application online. This project is just for educational purposes.

I created this project to clone the effect on website [https://messages.google.com/web](https://messages.google.com/web). I think this type of projects help in learning about real world software development.
